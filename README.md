# Customer Churn Prediction

## Problem Statement
Customer churn occurs when customers stop using a service.
This project predicts whether a customer will churn using historical data.

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Project Workflow
1. Created customer dataset using SQL
2. Performed data cleaning and analysis using Pandas
3. Built a Logistic Regression model
4. Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrix

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before model building, exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the dataset.

EDA steps included:
- Checking dataset shape and data types
- Identifying missing and duplicate values
- Analyzing statistical summary of features
- Visualizing churn distribution
- Analyzing correlation between numerical features using a heatmap

EDA helped in understanding customer behavior and selecting relevant features for model training.


## Model Used
- Logistic Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Conclusion
The model helps identify potential churn customers, allowing businesses to take preventive actions.
